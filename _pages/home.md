Welcome to my website. Here you can find information about myself, my background, my research interests and links to all materials related to my projects.

**Biography**

Born and bred in Hong Kong. I read Biomedical Sciences in my undergraduate career at the University of Hong Kong where I first fall in love with bioinformatics, statistics and large-scale data analyses. In 2016 I was awarded a scholarship from the [Croucher Foundation](https://croucher.org.hk/) to do a PhD at King's College London where I stay on and from 2020 work as a Research Associate.

I use and develop bioinformatics methods to mine and interpret large-scale datasets with the aim to understand the impact of mutations and sequence variations in cancers and the immune system. Read more [about myself](/about/) and details about my projects [here](/projects/).
