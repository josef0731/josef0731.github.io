# Computational Biology of Molecular Systems Laboratory

I will start a lab beginning January 2026 working on computational methods to study and characterise biological systems, at the Research Department of Structural & Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, UCL.

The goal of the lab is in new computational methods to characterise, interpret and predict the biological effects of molecular and cellular heterogeneity, with specific interests in immunity and cancer. We employ diverse approaches:

* **Omics**: with specific interest in bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, and innovative strategies leveraging these datasets to derive novel insights. 
* **Systems biology**: construction of molecular interaction networks from omics data; integration of functional genomics (RNA interference, CRISPR inactivation screens) to validate these interactions.
* **Sequence bioinformatics**: bioinformatics pipelines to detect hard-to-analyse sequence variations often missed in conventional sequencing data analysis; novel approaches to annotate transcript isoforms.
* **Structural biology, biophysics and biochemistry**: structural bioinformatics to model molecular interactions; impact of genetic variants in these systems.

Special interest in the lab lies in the molecular characterisation of cellular states of B cells in health and disease (specifically cancers), basic principles of antibody development *in vivo* and as therapeutics, and the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning approaches in these biological topics and more broadly in omics and systems biology problems.
