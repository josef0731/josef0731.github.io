        abstract = {Class-switch recombination (CSR) is an integral part of B cell maturation. Here we present sciCSR (pronounced 'scissor', single-cell inference of class-switch recombination), a computational pipeline that analyzes CSR events and dynamics of B cells from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments. Validated on both simulated and real data, sciCSR re-analyzes scRNA-seq alignments to differentiate productive heavy-chain immunoglobulin transcripts from germline 'sterile' transcripts. From a snapshot of B cell scRNA-seq data, a Markov state model is built to infer the dynamics and direction of CSR. Applying sciCSR on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination time-course scRNA-seq data, we observe that sciCSR predicts, using data from an earlier time point in the collected time-course, the isotype distribution of B cell receptor repertoires of subsequent time points with high accuracy (cosine similarity {\textasciitilde}0.9). Using processes specific to B cells, sciCSR identifies transitions that are often missed by conventional RNA velocity analyses and can reveal insights into the dynamics of B cell CSR during immune response.},

        abstract = {B cells are known to contribute to the anti-tumor immune response, especially in immunogenic tumors such as melanoma, yet humoral immunity has not been characterized in these cancers to detail. Here we show comprehensive phenotyping in samples of circulating and tumor-resident B cells as well as serum antibodies in melanoma patients. Memory B cells are enriched in tumors compared to blood in paired samples and feature distinct antibody repertoires, linked to specific isotypes. Tumor-associated B cells undergo clonal expansion, class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation and receptor revision. Compared with blood, tumor-associated B cells produce antibodies with proportionally higher levels of unproductive sequences and distinct complementarity determining region 3 properties. The observed features are signs of affinity maturation and polyreactivity and suggest an active and aberrant autoimmune-like reaction in the tumor microenvironment. Consistent with this, tumor-derived antibodies are polyreactive and characterized by autoantigen recognition. Serum antibodies show reactivity to antigens attributed to autoimmune diseases and cancer, and their levels are higher in patients with active disease compared to post-resection state. Our findings thus reveal B cell lineage dysregulation with distinct antibody repertoire and specificity, alongside clonally-expanded tumor-infiltrating B cells with autoimmune-like features, shaping the humoral immune response in melanoma.},

    abstract = "{Sustainable modern poultry production depends on effective protection against infectious disease and a diverse range of antibodies is key for an effective immune response. In the domestic chicken, somatic gene conversion is the dominant process in which the antibody immunoglobulin genes are diversified. Affinity maturation by somatic hypermutation (SHM) also occurs, but the relative contribution of gene conversion versus somatic hypermutation to immunoglobulin (Ig) gene diversity is poorly understood. In this study we use high throughput long read sequencing to study immunoglobulin diversity in multiple immune associated tissues in Rhode Island Red chickens. To better understand the impact of genetic diversification in the chicken, a novel gene conversion identification software was developed (BrepConvert). In this study, BrepConvert enabled the identification of over 1 million gene conversion events. Mapping the occurrence of putative somatic gene conversion (SGC) events throughout the variable gene region revealed repetitive and highly restricted patterns of genetic insertions in both the antibody heavy and light chains. These patterns coincided with the locations of genetic variability in available pseudogenes and align with antigen binding sites, predominately the complementary determining regions (CDRs). We found biased usage of pseudogenes during gene conversion, as well as immunoglobulin heavy chain diversity gene (IGHD) preferences during V(D)J gene rearrangement, suggesting that antibody diversification in chickens is more focused than the genetic potential for diversity would suggest.}",
