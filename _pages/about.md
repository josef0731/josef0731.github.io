**Joseph (Chi-Fung) Ng**

*PhD (King's College London)*
*BBiomedSc (University of Hong Kong)*

Joseph was born and raised in Hong Kong, and graduated with first class honours the degree of Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He did his PhD with Franca Fraternali at King’s College London, supported by the Croucher Foundation from Hong Kong, on mutators (proteins which generate mutations) and cancers, specifically focusing on the mechanism of the APOBEC3 family of proteins. In his postdoctoral research Joseph specialises in computational approaches to analyse large-scale transcriptomic, proteomics and network data, with a particular focus on cancer mutagenesis and B cell biology. 

Joseph's research interests lie in computational immunology (specifically the diversity of antibody repertoire, and characterising immunoglobulin sequence features and transitions in large-scale molecular profiles of B cells), and more broadly in innovative strategies to apply Artificial Intelligence approaches to unravel novel molecular mechanisms of antibody immunity and more geenral biological problems. Joseph's research applies deep learning and biological language models on single-cell datasets of transcriptomes and immune receptor repertoire datasets, to extract novel insights into the basic mechanisms of B cell maturation, and how this is modulated in the context of an immune response against vaccination, cancer and infection.
