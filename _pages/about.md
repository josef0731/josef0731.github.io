**Joseph (Chi-Fung) Ng**

*PhD (King's College London); BBiomedSc (University of Hong Kong)*

Joseph was born and raised in Hong Kong, and graduated with first class honours the degree of Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He did his PhD with Franca Fraternali at King's College London, supported by the Croucher Foundation from Hong Kong, on mutators (proteins which generate mutations) and cancers, specifically focusing on the mechanism of the APOBEC3 family of proteins. He is currently Research Associate in the Fraternali group, working on the analysis of large-scale transcriptomic, proteomics and network data, with a particular focus on cancer mutagenesis and B cell biology. Broad research themes include mutational impact (especially in relation to mutational signatures), and categorising immunoglobulin sequence features and transitions in large-scale molecular profiles of B cells.
