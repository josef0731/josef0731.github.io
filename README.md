Uses [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

Developed by Joseph Ng, Apr-Jul 2021

Website accessible by <https://josephng-bio.org>.

## Update content online

All pages/posts are written in markdown format. [This](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a nice cheat-sheet on how to format text in markdown.

To add pages/posts, use any one of the existing pages/posts as templates and modify.

* **Pages**: each main page of the website (accessible from menu bar at the top of the page) - i.e. 'People', 'Software' etc. All `.md` files in `_pages` directory.
* **Posts**: news updates (accessible from the bottom menu on the index page). All `.md` files in `_posts` directory.
* `assets` contain images and files. Images to be shown on pages/posts in the `images` subfolder; downloadable files in `downloads`. You can reference these files using paths relative to the root of this repository (i.e. location of this README), like this: `assets/images/example.png`. See examples in any pages/posts that include an image / a download link.

Note: these updates will **NOT** be immediately recompiled to update the webpage. To do so you need to build the site locally, and update files in the `docs/` directory (see below for explanation).

## Update content offline

This site was originally developed inside a docker container. All docker set up are available in the repo and follows this site: [here](https://www.cross-validated.com/Personal-website-with-Minimal-Mistakes-Jekyll-Theme-HOWTO-Part-I/).

You can change and update contents of the website, then 'serve' the website locally like so:

```
docker run --volume="$PWD:/usr/src/app" -p 4000:4000 -t jn-website jekyll serve --trace
```
The website is accessible locally via `http://0.0.0.0:4000/`.

Note that since third-party plugins were used (for twitter feed) github-pages cannot automatically recompile the website as updates on pages/posts get committed and pushed onto the repository. The work-around is to recompile the website locally and then update files in the `docs/`. To do so, follow [this link](https://www.cross-validated.com/Personal-website-with-Minimal-Mistakes-Jekyll-Theme-HOWTO-Part-III/). Briefly,

1. Build the website in production mode under the docker set up:

```
docker run --rm -it --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" --volume="$PWD:/usr/src/app" --env JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll build
```

This will update files in the `_site` directory.

2. Next, copy all files in the `_site` directory and paste into the `docs/` directory at the root of this repository.

3. The repository is set up in such a way that files in `docs/` are taken to build the html site. As soon as you update files in `docs/` the updates would show up as you refresh the website on your browser.
